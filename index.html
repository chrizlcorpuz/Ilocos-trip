		<h1>Malacanang of the north</h1>
		<p> The place used to be  the residence of late president Ferdinand Marcos and his family when 
		they visit  Ilocos Norte during their regime.
		A frequent feature in any Ilocos tour, the house itself was a gift from former First Lady 
		and current Representative of the 2nd District of Ilocos Norte, Imelda Marcos to her husband. 
		It was one of the many properties sequestered from the Marcoses after Marcos Sr. was removed from power.
		<br>
		</br>
		Malacañang of the North is a 5-hectare property that overlooks the serene Paoay Lake along with well-tended gardens. 
		It also had its own reservoir designed to collect rainwater. This made the mansion self-sustaining in terms of its water supply.
